# Learning Notes 

## Day 1 – JavaScript & Node JS

Today, started learning JavaScript basics to rewrite my Python logic in JS - (3rd and 4th of February 2026 )

Things I learned:
JavaScript runs using Node.js (not like Python directly)
JS File format : node ZeroToEnd.js

Initially, Installed the node.js and understood why we using node.js and checked the version of it in the command prompt just to verify whether the download is done or not.

Next, Forgot to refresh the VScode, got struck there for a while dont know why I was getting error, when I tried to check the node --version in the VS Terminal. Later when seeked help from GPT, Understood that we need to refresh/Restart the VS code once we have downloaded any framework ( Day-1 lesson) 
Next Started Understanding Coding Stuffs: 
For python its `def` whereas for JS it is written using the `function` keyword
  Example:
  function moveZerosToEnd(arr) { }

Arrays:
  Example:
  let arr = [1, 2, 0, 3];

For python we use len() and in JS it is:
  arr.length

JS uses `{}` instead of indentation (Confused)

Loops in JS:
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { }

( 4th feb) Today, Tried to replace all this to write the proper code, still didnt get the proper output. Need to check it tomorrow.
